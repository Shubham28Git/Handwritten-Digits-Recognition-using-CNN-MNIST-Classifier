# Image-Recognition-Using-CNN-MNIST-Classifier

The objective is to recognize text from images using five layers of a Sequential Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). 

Dataset contains 28,000 images.

After the data cleaning phase, the image is converted into a feature vector using convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

I choose to build it with Keras API, I achieved 99.671% of accuracy with this CNN model, this whole model was developed using Python.
